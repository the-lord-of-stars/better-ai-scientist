    "Experiment": "Implement and compare encoding schemes specifically designed for 2D geometric data: 1) Polar coordinate encoding (radius/angle), 2) Distance-to-cluster-centers encoding (using k-means on training data), 3) Original sinusoidal (baseline). Train each variant on all datasets, comparing: training convergence, sample quality (KL divergence), and mode coverage. Requires modifying only the embedding class while keeping network architecture fixed.",
